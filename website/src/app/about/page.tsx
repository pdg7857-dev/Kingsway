                Government work does not have a single front door. The same buyer might post on a
                national aggregator one week and a tiny municipal portal the next, under a title that
                looks nothing like the trade you actually do. Most contractors handle this by
                assigning someone to check a handful of sites on a loop, hoping nothing slips
                through. Plenty slips through.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is the problem I built my practice around. I am not a bid writer, a proposal
                shop, or a procurement consultant who sits in on your strategy meetings. I do one
                thing, and I do it better than a generalist ever could: I discover the opportunities
                that fit you, read the documents so you do not have to, and tell you which ones are
                worth chasing. You prepare and submit the bid. That line stays bright on purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before going independent, I spent years in government-procurement sales and account
                management, working directly with Canadian and U.S. businesses to get set up and win
                public work. That is the experience I bring to your account now.

              A procurement portal is built to be complete, not useful. It will happily show you
              every notice in the system, which means it shows you thousands of opportunities that
              have nothing to do with your business. Completeness is not the same as clarity. The
              flood of results is exactly why good bids get missed: the one that fits you is sitting
              on page nine, under a title you would never search for.
            </p>
            <p>
              My job is the opposite of the platform's. I am not trying to show you everything. I am
              trying to show you the handful of things that deserve a decision. That is the whole
              discipline: turning noise into a short, qualified list you can act on the same day.

              I got into this because I kept watching capable companies lose work they never knew
              existed. Not because their bid was weak, but because they never saw the notice in
              time, or it was filed under a title they would never have searched. That is a quiet,
              expensive way to lose, and it is entirely avoidable.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I made the watching my job. When you work with me, you get one person who knows
              your trade, knows the platforms, and reads every word, not a tool that buries you in
              alerts. I read every message that comes in and I answer it myself. That is the way I
              like to work, and I think it is the reason it works.
