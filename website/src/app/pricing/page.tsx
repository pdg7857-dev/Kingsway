  {
    q: "Why price by geography instead of per opportunity?",
    a: "Because counting opportunities would punish you for the thing you want most. The whole point is that I surface more winnable work, so charging per bid would be backwards. You pick the coverage you need (a province, a state, a region, or national) and I cover everything inside it, however many opportunities that turns out to be.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a setup fee or a contract?",
    a: "No setup fee. Coverage is a 12-month commitment, billed monthly. That is deliberate: it takes a full year to catch your complete opportunity cycle, annual contracts, renewals and the seasonal bids that only surface once a year. A few months would only show you part of the picture. The plan should pay for itself many times over across that year by putting winnable work in front of you that you would otherwise miss.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts as a jurisdiction?",
    a: "A province or a state. Federal opportunities (CanadaBuys and SAM.gov, GSA eBuy and the rest) are bundled into National coverage in each country, and I can add federal to a smaller plan when it makes sense for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cover both Canada and the United States?",
    a: "Yes. The North America plan at $4,999/month covers every province, territory and state plus federal on both sides of the border, in one consolidated feed. For federal, military or municipal programs with special needs, Enterprise is scoped and priced to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is not included?",
    a: "I do not write your proposals, build your pricing, or submit your bids. That is your edge and I do not get in the middle of it. I find, read and qualify the opportunities so your team spends its hours on the bids worth winning.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know it is worth it before paying?",
    a: "Book a discovery call. I will already have looked at your jurisdictions, so you will see real, current opportunities I have found and qualified before you commit to anything. You can also request a sample opportunity and judge the quality for yourself.",
